#Return the total number of commas used when writing all integers from [1, n] (inclusive) in standard number formatting.

#In standard formatting:

#A comma is inserted after every three digits from the right.
#Numbers with fewer than 4 digits contain no commas.

#Example 1:

#Input: n = 1002

#Output: 3

#Explanation:

#The numbers "1,000", "1,001", and "1,002" each contain one comma, giving a total of 3.
class Solution:
    def countCommas(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 1000:
            return 0
        
        return n - 999
